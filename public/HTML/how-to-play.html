      <p>
        Knightly knockout is a 1 v 1 fight to the death. first to win 3 rounds
        is the winner!
      </p>
      <p>Use WASD to move around and the mouse to look around</p>
      <p>
        Left mouse click is a light attack and a hold then release is a heavy
        attack
      </p>
      <p>
        Right mouse hold is a block, the block only lasts 0.7 seconds however!
      </p>
      <p>Enjoy the game!</p>
