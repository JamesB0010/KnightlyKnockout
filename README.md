<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![knightlyKnockoutblockingSs](https://github.com/JamesB0010/Year2UniWebGame/assets/98528984/9b14ff5d-9b03-4c14-9ba4-c8cad50ab5e7)

This is the web game i have created as part of my course work at Birmingham City University
<br>
As mentioned above it is a networked multiplayer game, where two players fight 1 vs 1, the first to win 3 rounds wins!
<br>
The game takes inspiration from games like <a href = "https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/for-honor">For Honor</a> and <a href = "https://chivalry2.com">Chivalry 2</a>

### Built With
<ul>
<li>The game is built to run in the browser on the web. </li>
<li>The game is a 3d game and so uses Three.js for its rendering</li>
<li>The game uses Ammo.js for its physics calculations</li>
<li>The game will be served from an express server which also handles player networking using socket.io</li>
<li>Nodemon and postman was used during the development of the server code to make the development experience easier</li>
</ul>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Replit

the code is hosted on the repl pointed to by <a href = "https://replit.com/@JamesBland/Year2UniWebGame">this</a> link

after following the link press run and then open in new tab

![Screenshot 2023-12-18 002141](https://github.com/JamesB0010/Year2UniWebGame/assets/98528984/1f0ac05a-9768-44b5-b7ec-69acd8b8496c)


### localhost

This section will cover setting the project up locally

#### Prerequisites

First you will need <a href = "https://nodejs.org/en/">node</a> installed on your machine
<br>
Node version v18.15.0 was used to develop the app, this version or any later versions should work to run the project

You will also need <a href = "https://desktop.github.com">github desktop</a> or <a href = "https://git-scm.com/downloads">git cli</a> installed

it is easier to clone the project with git desktop, the steps to clone the project with git cli are below

### Installation

How to install and setup the game to run on localhost


1. Clone the repo (Url can be used with github desktop too)

<ul>
  <li>To see the mid term submission of the game clone the mid-term-submission branch</li>
</ul>

```sh
git clone -b mid-term-submission https://github.com/JamesB0010/Year2UniWebGame.git
```

<ul>
  <li>or to see the current development version of the game then you can clone the repo from the main branch</li>
</ul>

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JamesB0010/Year2UniWebGame.git
   ```
2. Make sure the current directory is Year2UniWebGame/
   
3. Install NPM packages

Open your command line and set the current directory to the root of the project, an easy way to do this is by right clicking the project folder and selecting "Open in Terminal"


![open in terminal](https://github.com/JamesB0010/Year2UniWebGame/assets/98528984/804bff27-73f1-46c1-aa14-27ee7e63eb80)


then run:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To play the game open a terminal session in the root of the repository

Then run:
```sh
node server.js
```

or for development
```sh
nodemon server.js
```

You will see a log to the console saying "server running on http://localhost:3000" You can click the link or manually type the url into a web browser to see the landing page for the game website


![landingPage](https://github.com/JamesB0010/Year2UniWebGame/assets/98528984/bf24b81b-5150-4554-a57e-813d9b5fdaf1)


You can visit the sign up and log in pages and can type "/" then some giberish into the url bar to see the 404 page

![404](https://github.com/JamesB0010/Year2UniWebGame/assets/98528984/2a803277-51c2-47bb-b791-d787338b2c78)


Then one player can create a game and then both players should see the game (sometimes refered to as server or session or lobby) in the game list and can press join

![Making a new game](https://github.com/JamesB0010/Year2UniWebGame/assets/98528984/129fda79-609d-46f7-a866-10d090cbb814)


At this point you should see a loading screen

![Untitled video - Made with Clipchamp](https://github.com/JamesB0010/Year2UniWebGame/assets/98528984/c1190b93-17d6-4d29-a68e-7fa0451f5f3d)


after both tabs have been loaded you will be able to see both players are loaded into the game and their movements are replicated to each other

![WebGameTest](https://github.com/JamesB0010/Year2UniWebGame/assets/98528984/be295952-7c8d-4de1-a0b1-63348cd05f07)


<h3>Player Damage and rounds</h3>

players can do heavy attacks, light attacks and blocks,

a block is performed by holding right click and lasts 0.7 seconds

a light attack is performed by pressing the mouse button and a heavy attack is performed by holding the left button for half a second and then releasing

the light attack does 25 damage and the heavy attack does 50 damage on round 1.

to make the game get more difficult as the players play damage is inversley linked to the number of rounds the player has won

| Rounds won | Light attack damage | Heavy attack damage |
| --- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| 0 | 25 | 50 |
| 1 | 23 | 45 |
| 2 | 20 | 40 |

by doing this each round becomes longer and more stressfull and therefore increases in difficulty

when a player dies the opposing player gets a point added to their score and the first player to get 3 points wins
